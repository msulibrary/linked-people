# linked-people
A prototype software project that reworks a staff directory into linked open data. Supplementary code for article: "Linked Data is People: Building a Knowledge Graph to Reshape the Library Staff Directory" 

The code here is the application shell and markup for the application in production at [https://www.lib.montana.edu/people/](https://www.lib.montana.edu/people/). There is no live data in this repository. The goal with this code is to demonstrate markup practices and provide a sample code architecture for implementing a similar application with your own local data. The authors/creators are open for questions if you have any as you think about implementation of these ideas. You can find us at the contacts below.
